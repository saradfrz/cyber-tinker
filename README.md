# NewsHarbor

NewsHarbor is an Apache Airflow-based project designed to aggregate news from various sources, providing a centralized platform for monitoring and accessing news content efficiently.

## Overview

NewsHarbor automates the process of fetching news articles from diverse sources such as RSS feeds, news APIs, and websites. By leveraging Apache Airflow's workflow management capabilities, NewsHarbor allows users to define pipelines for collecting, processing, and storing news data seamlessly.

## Features

- **Source Aggregation**: Aggregate news articles from multiple sources including RSS feeds, news APIs, and websites.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Define custom workflows to fetch, process, and store news data according to specific requirements.
- **Scheduled Execution**: Schedule pipeline runs at predefined intervals to ensure timely updates of news content.
- **Data Storage**: Store news articles in a centralized database or data lake for easy retrieval and analysis.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Monitor pipeline executions and track logs to troubleshoot issues and ensure data integrity.
- **Scalability**: Scale pipeline execution and data processing to handle large volumes of news content efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with NewsHarbor, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Install Apache Airflow and set up the required environment.
2. **Configuration**: Configure NewsHarbor by specifying the sources from which news articles will be aggregated.
3. **Define Pipelines**: Define custom Apache Airflow DAGs to orchestrate the news aggregation process.
4. **Execute Pipelines**: Trigger pipeline runs manually or schedule them to run automatically at specified intervals.
5. **Monitor Execution**: Monitor pipeline execution status and review logs to ensure smooth operation.

## Dependencies

- Apache Airflow
- Python libraries (e.g., requests, BeautifulSoup) for web scraping and data processing
